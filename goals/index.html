            of our business

            Apparel, we believe in
            sustainable clothing that
            makes a difference. To
            us, fashion is much more
            than the fabrics we wear
            on our body. It is also
            about respect for people
            and the
            environment.

            <span style="letter-spacing: 2px; text-align: justify; line-height: 30px">
                KnowledgeCotton Apparel's business is built on the knowledge of sustainable fibers, the largest proportion being organic cotton. We carry this mindset with us every day when creating new products – all the way from the fiber to the finished result.
                <br> <br>

            We produce in compliance with the highest sustainable standards in the world. Our aim is to use yarns and fabrics in our collection that make the garments especially long lasting and sustainable.

                <br>  <br>
            Innovation is very important to us and we push the boundaries every day on how products and fibers can be made. We are deeply involved in the innovation process with our suppliers and help to create new sustainable fibers.
                
            <br> <br>
            At KnowledgeCotton Apparel, we classify our fibers according to their sustainable performance based on the “Made-By” Environmental Benchmark for fibers and the international standard for organic and recycled production.

            <span class="text-title">Recycled PET</span> <br>
            <span class="text-desc">PET is polyethylene terephthalate, a type of plastic derived from petroleum used to make soft drink bottles. Using recycled PET bottles, we create recycled PET polyester. The quality of recycled polyester is as good as virgin polyester – it is very resilient, quick drying, and easy to wash while keeping its shape.</span>
            <br> <br>
            <span class="text-title">Impact of human behavior</span> <br>
            <span class="text-desc">Over the past 50 years, plastic consumption has increased twenty-fold – from 15 million tonnes in 1964 to currently around 300 million. It has been estimated that this figure will double by 2025.
            Every year, approx. 10 million tonnes of plastic waste are making their way into the oceans, the equivalent of one truckload of garbage being tipped into the sea every minute. Plastic waste is almost like an eighth continent, and by 2050, it is estimated that there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean. It will take centuries for this waste to decompose; 450 to 700 years alone for PET bottles.</span>

            <span class="text-title">37% less CO2 emissions</span> <br>
            <span class="text-desc">CO₂ – Compared to the use of virgin polyester, using recycled polyester reduces carbon emissions by 37%.</span>

            <span class="text-title">25 PET bottles = One jacket</span> <br>
            <span class="text-desc">Did you know? – 25 old PET bottles are transformed into one KnowledgeCotton Apparel jacket.</span>
            <br> <br>

            <span class="text-title">Linen</span> <br>
            <span class="text-desc">Linen is a natural textile made from the fibers of the flax plant. Garments have been made from linen for thousands of years and it is one of the oldest fibers used for textile production. Linen is well-known for its strength, absorption and coolness to the touch. Organic linen is grown without any synthetic fertilizers.</span>

            <span class="text-title">Wool</span> <br>
            <span class="text-desc">All of the wool KnowledgeCotton Apparel uses is certified organic or certified recycled wool from merino sheep. We call this wool ‘happy sheep wool’ as it is produced with animal welfare and biodiversity in mind. It is 100% mulesing-free and certified ethical. The wool we use is mainly from South America.

            <span class="text-title">Tencel</span> <br>
            <span class="text-desc">Tencel is made from wood pulp from sustainably managed forest plantations. The fibre production is extremely eco-friendly since the wood fiber uses less water in the production process than cotton. The spinning process recycles water and reuses the solvent at a recovery rate of more than 99%. Tencel gives the garments a light, soft and smooth feel.</span>

            <span class="text-title">Recycled Nylon</span> <br>
            <span class="text-desc">100% of the recycled nylon fiber that we use is generated from post-consumer land field waste. All of our certified recycled nylon products are an important part of our environmental clean-up work.</span>

            <span class="text-title">Vegan products</span> <br>
            <span class="text-desc">We have a strong commitment in animal rights and use only certified organic wool or certified recycled wool in our products. All labeling is from 100% certified recycled materials. 95% of our total product portfolio is vegan approved.</span>
